# 🍍 Pineapple — The Guy With *Absolutely No Idea* What He’s Doing  

Hi, I’m **Pineapple**.  
A man with **zero clue**, **no direction**, and **one powerful tool**:  
✨ *AI doing 99.9% of the work for me* ✨

## 🧠 Totally Super Duper Smart (Trust Me Bro)
I may look like I have no idea what’s going on…  
Because I don’t.  
But with AI?  
Suddenly I’m a *genius*.  
A *prodigy*.  
A *10x developer* (if you don’t check the commit history too closely).

## 🤖 My Development Strategy
1. Think of idea  
2. Realize I have no idea how to build it  
3. Ask AI  
4. Pretend I knew it all along  
5. Deploy  
6. Question every life choice  
7. Repeat

## 🔧 Skills (According to AI)
- “Programming”
- “Tech stuff”
- Clicking ‘Regenerate Response’
- Forgetting the difference between frontend and backend
- Looking productive while panicking internally

## 🎯 Life Goals
- Figure out what I’m doing  
- Probably won’t  
- Build cool stuff anyway  
- Become the first fully AI-augmented human disaster success story  

## 📫 Contact
If you need me, I’ll be somewhere trying to understand code I supposedly wrote.
